Pykinetic is a Python-based solver for kinetic equations that includes the algorithms
of fast spectral method.  

Pykinetic is adopted form Pyclaw. It has been designed with easy extensibility, performance, and exploration in mind. 

PyKinetic also includes a scalable GPU implementation using cupy.
